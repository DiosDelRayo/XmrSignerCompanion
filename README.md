# License
License of my heart is BipCot NonGov Software License, but how I'm using Qt, so in case the license is not compatible it will fall back to BSD and from there to LGPL. Anyways shame on you if you one of this evil people working for any government entity. Your moral compass is or very off or you are simply one of that evil persons in the world. Governments are THE #1 criminal organizations.
